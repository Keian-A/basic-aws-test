I differed in 2 locations when initializing this project on the CLI than a few of my classmates. 1 was where the command line asked if I wanted to use a new project or if I wanted to create a new project. I chose to use the existing one where my classmates chose to create a new one entirely. The other place where we differed is their choice to include Amazon's CodeCommit whereas I chose to opt out of that.

## The server

The only route available on this server is '/' which sends a get request for the text 'Welcome to your basic server!'.
